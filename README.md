## User Guide

- Starting Gesture Recording: 
  - To begin recording your custom gesture, press the right button located on the board. This will activate the recording mode. 
- Unlocking the Board: 
  - To enter and check your gesture for unlocking the board, press the left button on the board. 
- Recording Mode Indicator: 
  - When in recording mode, you will notice that the small on-board LED is illuminated, indicating that the board is actively recording your gesture.
- Gesture Verification Outcome: 
  - After entering your gesture, the on-board LED will light up, conveying the result of the check. If the Neo Pixels illuminate in red, accompanied by an incorrect sound effect from the built-in speaker, it signifies that the entered gesture is incorrect. In contrast, if the Neo Pixels display a green color and you hear a correct sound effect from the on-board speaker, your entered gesture is correct. 
- Additional Monitoring Options: 
  - You can also access the serial monitor to check the current mode (whether it's in record or enter mode), the check result (correct or incorrect), and the recorded values, providing you with a more detailed view of the device's operation.
